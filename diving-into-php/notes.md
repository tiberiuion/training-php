## Client server model
Learned: Client sends request to server. PHP processes the request, queries a database if needed and returns a HTML response.

## Installation
Learned: Setup DDEV for this project.

The instrctor suggest installing php without the help of additional software but I decided to use DDEV instead.

### To run this
1. Install DDEV according to the instructons 
https://docs.ddev.com/en/stable/users/install/
2. Clone this repo.
3. CD into the root folder.
4. Run ddev config.
5. Run ddev launch. 
   
## Configuring PHP
Learned: PHP configuration is done inside the php.ini file.

Not sure how DDEV handles this. There's a php.ini in the .ddev folder but I need to learn more abotu it. So far I don't think this wll get in the way of leanring PHP.

## A PHP file
Learned: PHP code inside an HTML file need to be delimited by an opening and closing tags. If the file contains only PHP code, the closing tag can be ommitted.

## Hello world
Learned: phpinfo() is a useful function that prints out a lot of info about PHP.

I have set up phpinfo.php in this folder.

## Documentation
Manual: https://www.php.net/manual/en/index.php

Trick: https://www.php.net/phpinfo

If you add a function name at the end of the php.net url, you will get redirected to the docs for that function.
